# AIR BREATHING CYCLE ANALYSIS README.md

# Goals: 
- Create an air-breathing parametric cycle analysis function that allows for minimizing thrust specific fuel consumption while keeping thrust above necessary mission requirements.
- Takes engine inputs such as: post-burner maximum temperature, fan and compressor pressure ratios, bypass ratios, etc and yields specific thrust and fuel consumption as outputs.

# Currently in WIP; would not reccomend use as is.
